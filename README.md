# Scale-identifier
Musical scale identifier built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

=================WIP=================
Basic functionality of the app is to recognize common (maybe later rare or exotic) musical scales e.g. C Major or F Minor.
If the above features work, there might be some room for chords recognition but at the moment I won't take it to the consideration or realization.
